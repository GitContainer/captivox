make a whole lot of cool dot animations using the Power of Parametric™ Maths™ Equations

I want to try!
-----
Just run `pip install -r requirements.txt` and then `python3 dots.py`.

Optionally, run `pip install imageio` if you want to export videos.

Oh, and be sure to use pip for python3, not python2. This project is python3 only.

What does it look like?

Like this!

Can I contribute?

the code is in `dots.py`, you're welcome to make pull requests. I know I'm not the best designer in the world so I would especially welcome improvements in that area.
